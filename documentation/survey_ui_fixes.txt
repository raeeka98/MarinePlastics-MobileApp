This lists the things that are broken or aren't user friendly when filling out
  the survey.

When done filling out a textbox, user has to click “return” instead of a special
  “done” button. This made me stuck for a while.
When inputting data in the bottom textboxes for the “Team Information” section,
  the phone popup keyboard covers the textboxes so users can’t see what they are
  typing.
The Date is in the format dd/mm/yyyy.
The X, title of the survey part, and “Finish” button, are not centered
  vertically with the blue top bar.
COI recommended not using accordian style for “Area” section.
Long header names are cut off.
When typing in textboxes in “Area” section, the beginning of the word is cut off.
No decimal option for numerical textboxes.
“Get Coordinates” doesn’t work.
No “return” or “done” option for numerical textboxes.
Time slot for tide is broken and says “Set a date”.
If attempt to publish a survey while not logged in, app freezes.
Textboxes can’t currently have punctuation.
