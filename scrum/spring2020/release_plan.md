## Product Backlog
1. QR code scanning Design 
As a user, I want to easily scan a QR code for rib scans.
2. As a user, I want to be able to use voice recognition to take a survey with the mobile app so I don’t have to scroll through the app and manually input data on the trash
3. As a user, I want to be able to sign in on the app, not be sent to an Auth0 page, because that can be confusing and inconvenient.
4. As a user, I want to see the pins of the beach locations on the map be different colors (web app).
