 * Instead of some paragraphs to serve as an on-boarding session, it'll be much better to
 * create a little tutorial guide that shows the user how to fill out and generate QR codes

            The survey on this app is a digital translation of
            COI's paper protocol. But there are some changes that should be noted. We have integrated QR code scanning
            and generation in this app to make it easier for groups to split up and work on different ribs during the survey.
            Only one survey must fill out the "Team Information" and "Survey Area" portion. This survey would be considered as
            the "Master Survey", which will be used to scan all other form, if there are any, for this particular survey.
            QR codes can be generated after the survey is saved.
